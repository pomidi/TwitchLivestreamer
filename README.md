# TwitchLiveStreamerApp

TwitchLiveStreamer will update the user's subscription list using [TwitchAPI] to run w/o any internet browers. TwitchLiveStreamer uses [Livestreamer] to stream a channel. The online user-interface will update each channel status so the user is less dependent on any brower to stream his favorite channels.  

There is no Log-in required and by only typing in your twitch ID, the program is able to collect your following list on twitch and updates their status on a regular basis.

This Applicatoin is inspired by [qLiveStreamer] and is made using Qt5.5.

#Important Notes
